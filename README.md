# Compiler Construction Course Project

### Developer Information
- **Name**: Samia Liaqat
- **Registration Number**: 2021-CS-128

### Project Description
This repository contains the project files for the Compiler Construction course offered in Fall 2024. The project involves step-by-step implementation of a simple compiler. It covers various phases of the compilation process such as lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation.

### Project Contents
- **Source Code**: The source code files for each stage of the compiler implementation are located in the `src/` folder, organized by phases of the compiler (e.g., `lexer`, `parser`, `codegen`).
- **Test Files**: Sample input programs and their corresponding outputs can be found in the `test/` folder to validate each stage of the compiler.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation about each phase of the compiler and instructions on how to run the code are available in the `docs/` folder.
